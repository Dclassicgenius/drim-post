# Mastering React Hooks: Beyond the Basics

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components, providing a more intuitive way to use state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

## Core Hooks Explained

### useState

The most fundamental hook for managing component state:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useEffect

Handle side effects and component lifecycle:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform side effect
  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup
  };
}, [dependency]);
```

## Creating Custom Hooks

Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions:

```jsx
function useCustomHook() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);
  // Custom logic here
  return { state, setState };
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks at the top level
- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Separate concerns with multiple hooks
- Write clean, readable hook logic

## Conclusion

Hooks provide a powerful way to write more functional and modular React code. Continue exploring and experimenting!
